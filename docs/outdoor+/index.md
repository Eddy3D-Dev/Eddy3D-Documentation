## Overview
**UMCF** (`urbanMicroclimateFoam`) is an open-source solver for coupled physical processes modeling urban microclimate based on `OpenFOAM`.

### Key Features
 **CFD** - Solves turbulent, convective airflow
- Handles heat and moisture transport in the `air` subdomain

 **HAM** - Manages absorption and transport
- Controls storage of heat and moisture in porous building materials

 **RAD** - Calculates net longwave and shortwave radiative heat fluxes
- Uses view factor approach

 **VEG** - Solves heat balance for urban trees
- Handles green surfaces
